# Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) and Time-Varying MVAR (TV-MVAR) Estimation

This repository provides a comprehensive Python toolbox for **simulation and estimation of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models**, supporting both **time-invariant** and **time-varying** formulations. The framework is designed for analyzing **multivariate and potentially non-stationary time-series data**, with a primary focus on neuroscientific signals (e.g., fMRI, EEG, iEEG, LFP), while remaining applicable to general dynamical networked systems.

Estimated MVAR and TV-MVAR parameters can be directly used to derive **functional and effective connectivity measures**, including time-resolved connectivity in both the time and frequency domains.
