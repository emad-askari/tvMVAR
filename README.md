# Time-Varying Multivariate Autoregressive (TV-MVAR) Estimation

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for **simulating and estimating time-varying multivariate autoregressive (TV-MVAR) models**.  
The toolbox is designed for analyzing **non-stationary multivariate time series**, with a primary focus on neuroscientific signals (e.g., fMRI, EEG, LFP), but it is readily applicable to any dynamic networked system.

The estimated TV-MVAR parameters can be directly used to derive **time-resolved functional and effective connectivity measures** in both the time and frequency domains.
